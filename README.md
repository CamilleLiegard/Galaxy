This project was realised following Ania Kubow's tutorial : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6M-rZIukXy0.

I highly recommend here tutorials they are well explained and it's a good opportunity to explore various features.

This project was created to explore the different animation features of CSS and to create a pleasant animation that can be seen on any screen.

HTML and CSS have been used to develop this project.

It is a goot exercise to explore shapres, colors and the animation options that exist within css (Keyframe@). It is also visually pleasant.
